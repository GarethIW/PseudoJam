PseudoJam
=========

Gareth and Paul's 48 hour game jam, attempt one!

A 48-hour game jam, loosely adhering to Ludum Jam rules, and using the last Ludum theme - "You are the villain!"

This is our first attempt at a jam.

The jam will run from approximately 18:00 GMT 29/12/2012 until 18:00 GMT 31/12/2012

There will be a livestream as far as is possible at http://twitch.tv/garethiw - please join in with the chat for moral support!


Executable!
-----------

A Windows executable (zipped) is available here: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=D7FBB055A9855C17!151

It will be updated sporadically throughout the 48 hours.

The game requires OpenAL: http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip

It's been tested on a Windows 7 machine without any other pre-reqs, but YMMV!


Source Code
-----------

In order to compile the solution, you'll need:

- Visual Studio 2012
- The Windows Phone 8 SDK (For the XNA Content Pipeline which is compiled via a Windows Phone Game project)
- Monogame DLLS (You can fork monogame and compile them or use the latest Monogame installer)
- Windows 8 / Windows 8 SDK (ONLY to load/compile the Windows 8 project)

You can also take the content and source and add them to a new XNA Game Studio 4 project in VS2010.

Pre-existing code used:

- TiledLib (https://bitbucket.org/nickgravelyn/tiledlib)
- The XNA Gamestate Management library (http://xbox.create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management)
