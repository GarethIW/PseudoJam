PseudoJam
=========

Gareth and Paul's 48 hour game jam, attempt one!

A 48-hour game jam, loosely adhering to Ludum Jam rules, and using the last Ludum theme - "You are the villain!"

This is our first attempt at a jam.

The jam will run from approximately 17:00 GMT 29/12/2012 until 17:00 GMT 31/12/2012

There will be a livestream as far as is possible at http://twitch.tv/garethiw - please join in with the chat for moral support!
